# June 22 Monthly Report

## Executive Summary

 - **Trafic is down**: Visits to GOV.UK have fallen, but with increased interest this month in the P800 tax return, cost of living and school uniforms as well as increased interest in Covid content and visa applications
 - **Cost of living**: Searches for cost of living have increased. Benefits and financial support checker tool needs improvement. Users find cost of living campaign guidance confusing
 - **User feedback**: Passport and driving license renewals as well as Covid test and tax refund letters were the main feedback clusters we had this month. Majority of feedback has been classified as neutral/ negative

### Headline Metrics
 - **GOV.UK received 103.2 million visits**: This is a decrease of 9% on May 2022 and 28% down on June 2021
 - **Many users visit cost of living content**: The cost of living payment guidance had 900k visits in June, the new campaign site had 130k and the new tool had 610k
 - **Renewed interest in Covid content**: There’s been growth in users looking for guidance around Covid and reporting test results

### Recommendations and Actions
 - **Ofcom’s Online Nation report reminds us of the digital divide**: 20% of 65+ adults don’t have internet access from home. 2m households (in September 2021) were experiencing affordability problems with their connections. We should be thinking about what is our offering for digitally excluded users
 - **Announcements don’t always lead users to actions**: The right to buy announcement gained media attention but there was no clear next step for users. There was much user interest in school uniform grants but only some councils offer this help
 - **Reconsider share buttons**: There have been social media share buttons on news pages on GOV.UK since December 2013. But the level of use is low. Should they be redesigned or removed?
