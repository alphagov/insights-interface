# June 22 Monthly Report

## Executive Summary

 - **Trafic is down**: Visits to GOV.UK have fallen, but with increased interest this month in the P800 tax return, cost of living and school uniforms as well as increased interest in Covid content and visa applications
 - **Cost of living**: Searches for cost of living have increased. Benefits and financial support checker tool needs improvement. Users find cost of living campaign guidance confusing
 - **User feedback**: Passport and driving license renewals as well as Covid test and tax refund letters were the main feedback clusters we had this month. Majority of feedback has been classified as neutral/ negative

### Headline Metrics
 - **GOV.UK received 103.2 million visits**: This is a decrease of 9% on May 2022 and 28% down on June 2021
 - **Many users visit cost of living content**: The cost of living payment guidance had 900k visits in June, the new campaign site had 130k and the new tool had 610k
 - **Renewed interest in Covid content**: There’s been growth in users looking for guidance around Covid and reporting test results

### Recommendations and Actions
 - **Ofcom’s Online Nation report reminds us of the digital divide**: 20% of 65+ adults don’t have internet access from home. 2m households (in September 2021) were experiencing affordability problems with their connections. We should be thinking about what is our offering for digitally excluded users
 - **Announcements don’t always lead users to actions**: The right to buy announcement gained media attention but there was no clear next step for users. There was much user interest in school uniform grants but only some councils offer this help
 - **Reconsider share buttons**: There have been social media share buttons on news pages on GOV.UK since December 2013. But the level of use is low. Should they be redesigned or removed?

The first 3 pages are explained on later slides. 

The Child Maintenance Service page reflects recent changes in how GOV.UK links to the [service](https://childmaintenanceservice.direct.gov.uk/) itself. 

HMRC services seem to have had some problems around 7-9 June.

### Rising and falling searches - June vs May

#### Rising searches

1. P800[^1] tax refund and tax calculation
2. Cost of living payment
3. Of lower volume searches:
 - Pension credit
 - Customs declaration service
 - Covid tests
 - Right to buy
4. Shool uniforms

[^1]: *The P800 tax calculation is the letter sent out by HMRC at this time of year to taxpayers who have ove or under-paid their tax*

#### Falling Searches

1. Passports - 'urgent' and 'fast track' passports
2. Various (holiday) destinations - e.g. Spain, Italy, Greece
3. Self assessment
4. Student finance 

Many of the falls reflect retreats from May peaks. HMRC is currently writing to 220,000 businesses about moving to the Customs Declaration Service.

### Top news stories in June

The top five news stories were: 

1. [Over 8 million households to get CoL payment from 14 July](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/over-eight-million-households-to-get-new-cost-of-living-payment-from-14-july) (142k) - 15 June
2. [£1,200 of help with cost of living](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/millions-of-most-vulnerable-households-will-receive-1200-of-help-with-cost-of-living) (108k) - 26 May
3. [Self-isolation for those with COVID-19 can end after 5 full days following 2 negative LFD tests](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/self-isolation-for-those-with-covid-19-can-end-after-five-full-days-following-two-negative-lfd-tests)[^2] (84k) - 13 Jan 2022, updated 4 Feb
4. [Monkeypox cases - latest updates](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/monkeypox-cases-confirmed-in-england-latest-updates) (80k) - 14 May
5. [Energy Bills Support Scheme explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/energy-bills-support-scheme-explainer) (77k) - 1 Apr

The appearance of old news stories may suggest a need for more permanent content on that subject and/or is a failure of search engines to point at a more appropriate page.

Most Covid guidance is on the NHS site or has been redirected. But this news story still surfaces in Google.

[^2]: *The reappearance of this page interesting. Traffic seems to be coming from search engines for phrases like “how long do you have to isolate with covid”, “when can i return to work after a positive covid test uk” etc. GOV.UK competes with NHS for those searches; the position and click through rate varies among different wordings.*

### Key Government Publications

The most popular publications in June were:

## Content that peaked in June

### Right to buy announcement

The government made an [announcement on 9 June](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/right-to-buy-extension-to-make-home-ownership-possible-for-millions-more-people) that it would extend the right to buy scheme to housing association tenants and reform UC to help people save for a deposit.
