# July 22 Monthly Report

## Executive Summary

 - **Trafic is down**: Visits to GOV.UK have fallen, but with increased interest this month in the P800 tax return, cost of living and school uniforms as well as increased interest in Covid content and visa applications
 - **Cost of living**: Searches for cost of living have increased. Benefits and financial support checker tool needs improvement. Users find cost of living campaign guidance confusing
 - **User feedback**: Passport and driving license renewals as well as Covid test and tax refund letters were the main feedback clusters we had this month. Majority of feedback has been classified as neutral/ negative

### Headline Metrics
 - **GOV.UK received 103.2 million visits**: This is a decrease of 9% on May 2022 and 28% down on June 2021
 - **Many users visit cost of living content**: The cost of living payment guidance had 900k visits in June, the new campaign site had 130k and the new tool had 610k
 - **Renewed interest in Covid content**: There’s been growth in users looking for guidance around Covid and reporting test results

### Recommendations and Actions
 - **Ofcom’s Online Nation report reminds us of the digital divide**: 20% of 65+ adults don’t have internet access from home. 2m households (in September 2021) were experiencing affordability problems with their connections. We should be thinking about what is our offering for digitally excluded users
 - **Announcements don’t always lead users to actions**: The right to buy announcement gained media attention but there was no clear next step for users. There was much user interest in school uniform grants but only some councils offer this help
 - **Reconsider share buttons**: There have been social media share buttons on news pages on GOV.UK since December 2013. But the level of use is low. Should they be redesigned or removed?

### Fasted growing content - June vs May
These pages had the biggest increases in traffic (June vs May 2022). *This only includes pages with >50k visits in June.*

1. [Help with school uniform costs](https://www.gov.uk/help-school-clothing-costs): 105k visits, +667% on May, +1% YoY
2. [Temporary work - charity worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/temporary-worker-charity-worker-visa): 68k, +526%, +1,110% YoY
3. [Check income tax paid last year](https://www.gov.uk/check-income-tax-last-year): 596k, +442%, -22% YoY
4. [HMRC service availability](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hm-revenue-and-customs-service-availability-and-issues): 73k, +356%
5. [Child maintenance service](https://www.gov.uk/child-maintenance-service/sign-in-account): 178k, +251%, n/a

The first 3 pages are explained on later slides. 

The Child Maintenance Service page reflects recent changes in how GOV.UK links to the [service](https://childmaintenanceservice.direct.gov.uk/) itself. 

HMRC services seem to have had some problems around 7-9 June.

### Rising and falling searches - June vs May

#### Rising searches

1. P800[^1] tax refund and tax calculation
2. Cost of living payment
3. Of lower volume searches:
 - Pension credit
 - Customs declaration service
 - Covid tests
 - Right to buy
4. Shool uniforms

[^1]: *The P800 tax calculation is the letter sent out by HMRC at this time of year to taxpayers who have ove or under-paid their tax*

#### Falling Searches

1. Passports - 'urgent' and 'fast track' passports
2. Various (holiday) destinations - e.g. Spain, Italy, Greece
3. Self assessment
4. Student finance 

Many of the falls reflect retreats from May peaks. HMRC is currently writing to 220,000 businesses about moving to the Customs Declaration Service.

### Top news stories in June

The top five news stories were: 

1. [Over 8 million households to get CoL payment from 14 July](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/over-eight-million-households-to-get-new-cost-of-living-payment-from-14-july) (142k) - 15 June
2. [£1,200 of help with cost of living](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/millions-of-most-vulnerable-households-will-receive-1200-of-help-with-cost-of-living) (108k) - 26 May
3. [Self-isolation for those with COVID-19 can end after 5 full days following 2 negative LFD tests](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/self-isolation-for-those-with-covid-19-can-end-after-five-full-days-following-two-negative-lfd-tests)[^2] (84k) - 13 Jan 2022, updated 4 Feb
4. [Monkeypox cases - latest updates](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/monkeypox-cases-confirmed-in-england-latest-updates) (80k) - 14 May
5. [Energy Bills Support Scheme explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/energy-bills-support-scheme-explainer) (77k) - 1 Apr

The appearance of old news stories may suggest a need for more permanent content on that subject and/or is a failure of search engines to point at a more appropriate page.

Most Covid guidance is on the NHS site or has been redirected. But this news story still surfaces in Google.

[^2]: *The reappearance of this page interesting. Traffic seems to be coming from search engines for phrases like “how long do you have to isolate with covid”, “when can i return to work after a positive covid test uk” etc. GOV.UK competes with NHS for those searches; the position and click through rate varies among different wordings.*

### Key Government Publications

The most popular publications in June were:

1. [Cost of living support factsheet: 26 May 2022](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cost-of-living-support/cost-of-living-support-factsheet-26-may-2022) (180k visits): 26 May 2022
2. [Car “show me, tell me” questions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/car-show-me-tell-me-vehicle-safety-questions/car-show-me-tell-me-vehicle-safety-questions) (139k visits, -2% YoY): 4 Dec 2017
3. [The National Minimum Wage in 2022](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-national-minimum-wage-in-2022) (107k visits): 1 Apr 2022
4. [High Potential Individual visa: global universities list 2021](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-potential-individual-visa-global-universities-list/high-potential-individual-visa-global-universities-list-2021) (103k visits): 6 May
5. [Form - claim Child Benefit](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/child-benefit-claim-form-ch2)  (95k visits, +8% YoY): 11 Apr 2014

These are the same 5 publications as May, though traffic volumes have fallen for all of them.

## Content that peaked in June

### Right to buy announcement

The government made an [announcement on 9 June](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/right-to-buy-extension-to-make-home-ownership-possible-for-millions-more-people) that it would extend the right to buy scheme to housing association tenants and reform UC to help people save for a deposit.

 - The press release had 54,000 visits but did not link to any further detail of the announcement
 - It also had the impact of increasing visit to the [Right to Buy council home content](https://www.gov.uk/right-to-buy-buying-your-council-home). Even at the end of June, visits were still running 1/3rd higher than before the announcement
 - There were similar patterns of increases in the [Right to Acquire content](https://www.gov.uk/right-to-acquire-buying-housing-association-home) for housing association properties. Again, this does not refer to the 9 June announcement
 - There were further announcements in Committee and in Parliament on 13 and 14 June, but details will only be revealed “in due course”

### Annual campaign on P800 tax refunds

The mass mailings of the P800 tax calculation form is a regular feature of late June and early July. HMRC sends them to people who’ve paid too much or too little tax.

 - The form includes the short URL gov.uk/p800refund which redirects and tracks users, sending them to /check-income-tax-last-year
 - The P800 refund campaign is one of the busiest. There were 403,000 arrivals from the short URLs in June 2022. (This is down 60% on last year but the campaign timings vary.)
 - Despite printing the URL on the form there still about 7,000 examples of the URL being mistyped; almost 4509 variations in all

### Help to save

 - [Help to Save](https://www.gov.uk/get-help-savings-low-income) is a scheme for people on Universal Credit to save where the government gives them 50p for every £1 saved. It launched in 2018 and there are regular peaks to the sign in page on the 1st of the month. 
 - This month saw a particularly large spike in page views with 98k pageviews, up 15% on May and 24% on June 2021.
 - Feedback shows that the service was down for a period on the 1st, with people frustrated they were unable to pay in-to their accounts.

### Seasonal claims for school uniform grants

<iframe width="902" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTsI315sPePIXEAfc7eHJsgBpeXYFJglYORtAzV0IEL9geASqkUwC6mjlt6OFRgSUeRn4sncfUxuHjo/pubchart?oid=1241811414&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

 - There are regular peaks around [help with school uniform costs](https://www.gov.uk/help-school-clothing-costs) content every June or July. In June 2022, we had 105k visits to the page - an increase of 1% on last June
 - Some feedback claims that the links to local council sites aren’t working or are incorrect - for example the button for [Bedford council](https://www.gov.uk/help-school-clothing-costs/bedford) has no link, the link to [Hull council](https://www.gov.uk/help-school-clothing-costs/kingston-upon-hull) errors intermittently (and looks like it’s pointing to the wrong URL[^3]). 
 - Some council links point to local council homepages rather than content on school uniform support. So we’re not pointing the users to the right content (for example [Cheshire West Council](https://www.gov.uk/help-school-clothing-costs/cheshire-west-and-chester) points to the council homepage when it should link to here), and relies on users to search through another site.
 
 
**Recommendation**: poor local transaction links complicate journeys for our users so improvements need to be made
 
[^3]: There was a report on Slack (5 July) that of 286 links to the ‘School clothing grants/vouchers’ service in the local links manager, 128 are currently missing or broken.
 
## Cost of living
 
### Searches and feedback 
 
>*“was advised to go to this page this information needs to be set out much clearer for people”*
 
>*“this guidance is not clear and does not make sense”*
 
>*“to look up info on cost of living payments too much info presented in a complex way”*
 
>*“checking cost of living payment… there is no mention of entitlement if you receive carers allowance”*

 - Searches for the broad term ‘cost of living’ have increased 221% compared to May (19k searches)
 - The [Cost of Living Payment guidance page](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-of-living-payment) was updated on 20 June and received 896k visits in June (+309% on May). There were 96 feedback comments left this month with the major themes being:
   - Complaints that guidance is confusing [9] 
   - Specific questions on eligibility [22]
   - Does a person need to apply or is the payment automatic? Some people are looking for a form or phone number to apply [13] 
   - People needing urgent financial assistance [5] with one request for an advance loan
